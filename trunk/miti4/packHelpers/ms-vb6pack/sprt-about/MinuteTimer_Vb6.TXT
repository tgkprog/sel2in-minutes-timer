The cab file for your application has been built as 'D:\prog\vb\minuteAlarm\g\miti4\Package\MinutesTimer_Vb6.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (D:\prog\vb\minuteAlarm\g\miti4\Package\Support\MinutesTimer_Vb6.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
